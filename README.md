# Cross-Domain-Image-to-Image-Translation-with-VQGAN-and-BBDM
Applied the architecture of the BBDM (Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model) in a cross-domain image-to-image translation on CelebAMask-HQ Dataset. Performed the diffusion process in the latent space of the VQGAN.
Continued the work of this paper by adding different commands, training on CelebaMask-HQ Dataset, and adding a visualization demo.
